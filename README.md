This respository is mainy the code i pratice in codeforces .
*The solution to 2d spiral matrix is that i took 4 variables mainly top,bottom,left,rigth
and travserse from  keeping the top constant then left -> rigth -> then incrementing top++ 
then  kepping the rigth constant and traversing top to bottom and decrementing rigth and and then traversing rigth to left and keeping the bottom constant
and then incrementing bottom and traversing from top to bottom and then incrementting left++
